                Aries, what do you want to contribute more of? What would make you happy and enable you to leave a lasting impression? True legacy has nothing to do with money; rather, it is the lives we touch, the actions we do that alter the course of events, the way we conduct ourselves in front of others and ourselves, and of course, how we take care of ourselves and inspire others to do the same for themselves. These are genuine adjustments that have a long-term effect. Therefore, will you think about your legacy today when you are busy creating an empire?<br/>
